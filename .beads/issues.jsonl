{"id":"twinscribe-3by","title":"[ARCH] Remove static analysis as ground truth authority","description":"## Summary\nDemote static analysis (PyCG/AST) from authoritative ground truth to optional hints. The dual-stream LLM consensus will become the new source of truth for call graph validation.\n\n## Background\nCurrently twinscribe treats static analysis results as the authoritative \"ground truth\" for call graphs. This approach:\n- Only works for Python (via PyCG/AST)\n- Cannot support languages without static analyzers (COBOL, JCL, legacy code)\n- Assumes static analysis is always correct (it often misses dynamic calls)\n\n## Changes Required\n\n### 1. Update Comparator Agent (`src/twinscribe/agents/comparator.py`)\n- Remove requirement for `ground_truth_call_graph` parameter\n- Change decision hierarchy from \"static analysis is AUTHORITATIVE\" to \"consensus is AUTHORITATIVE\"\n- Update `_determine_resolution()` to prefer stream consensus over ground truth\n- Modify `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to reflect new authority model\n\n### 2. Update Validator Agent (`src/twinscribe/agents/validator.py`)\n- Make `ground_truth_call_graph` optional in `ValidatorInput`\n- Update `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to treat static analysis as hints, not truth\n- Modify validation logic to flag discrepancies without auto-correcting to ground truth\n\n### 3. Update Orchestrator (`src/twinscribe/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`)\n- Make `static_oracle` optional in `DualStreamOrchestrator.__init__()`\n- Update `_run_iteration()` to work without ground truth\n- Modify `_apply_ground_truth_resolution()` to use consensus instead\n\n### 4. Update Models\n- `ComparatorInput.ground_truth_call_graph` - make optional\n- `ValidatorInput.ground_truth_call_graph` - make optional\n- Add new model for consensus-based resolution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] System can run without any static analyzer configured\n- [ ] Comparator uses stream consensus as primary authority\n- [ ] Validator flags discrepancies but defers to consensus for resolution\n- [ ] All existing tests pass with static analysis still available\n- [ ] New tests verify consensus-based operation\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/agents/comparator.py`\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/agents/validator.py`\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/models/comparison.py`\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/models/validation.py`\n\n## Complexity\n**Size:** L (Large)\n**Risk:** Medium - Core architectural change but backward compatible","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:40:27.080979-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi","updated_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.613747-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.613747-07:00","close_reason":"Implemented consensus-based resolution architecture","labels":["architecture","call-graph","consensus","refactoring"]}

Your task is to generate comprehensive \ndocumentation for code components including accurate call graph linkages.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Document ALL parameters, return values, and exceptions\n2. Identify ALL function/method calls made BY this component (callees)\n3. When available, identify callers OF this component\n4. Be precise about call site line numbers\n5. Distinguish between direct calls, conditional calls, and calls in loops\n\nYou have access to:\n- The source code of the focal component\n- Documentation of dependencies (already processed)\n- Optional static analysis hints\n\nOutput in the specified JSON schema. Do not hallucinate call relationships \nthat don't exist in the code.\n```\n\n2. **Validator System Prompt (Section 3.2):**\n```\nYou are a documentation validation agent. Your task is to verify that \ndocumentation is complete and that call graph linkages are accurate.\n\nVALIDATION RULES:\n- All parameters in code must be documented\n- All return paths must be documented\n- All exceptions that can be raised must be documented\n- Call graph MUST match static analysis (static analysis wins if conflict)\n```\n\n3. **Comparator System Prompt (Section 3.3):**\n```\nYou are the arbitration agent responsible for comparing documentation outputs \nfrom two independent streams and resolving discrepancies.\n\nDECISION HIERARCHY:\n1.

Never guess - escalate unclear cases\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Store templates in separate files or as constants\n- Support template variable substitution\n- Include JSON schema instructions in prompts\n\nReference: Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 of dual_stream_documentation_spec_v2.md","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"python-engineer","created_at":"2026-01-06T13:48:51.653592524-07:00","created_by":"andras","updated_at":"2026-01-07T08:48:32.594805097-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T08:48:32.594805097-07:00","close_reason":"System prompt templates are already implemented and embedded in the agent classes (documenter.py lines 143-160, validator.py lines 144-164, comparator.py lines 139-164).

{"id":"twinscribe-b6a","title":"[ARCH] Implement call graph feedback loop to documenters","description":"## Summary\nWhen `StreamCallGraphComparison` detects discrepancies between Stream A and Stream B call graphs, feed those discrepancies back to both documenters as corrections, then re-run documentation until the streams converge.\n\n## Background\nThe current system uses static analysis to resolve call graph discrepancies. With the shift to consensus-based truth (twinscribe-3by), we need a mechanism for the streams to learn from each other and converge organically.\n\n## Implementation Design\n\n### 1. Create Discrepancy Feedback Model\n```python\n# New model in models/feedback.py\nclass CallGraphFeedback(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Feedback to send to documenter about call graph discrepancies.\"\"\"\n    component_id: str\n    missing_edges: list[CallEdge]  # \"Stream B found these calls you missed\"\n    extra_edges: list[CallEdge]    # \"Stream B didn't find these calls you reported\"\n    other_stream_evidence: str     # Why the other stream believes its graph\n    iteration: int\n```\n\n### 2. Extend Documenter Input\n- Add `call_graph_corrections: list[CallGraphFeedback]` to `DocumenterInput`\n- Update documenter prompts to incorporate corrections\n\n### 3. Add Feedback Generation in Orchestrator\n```python\ndef _generate_call_graph_feedback(\n    self,\n    comparison: StreamCallGraphComparison,\n    stream_a_outputs: dict,\n    stream_b_outputs: dict,\n) -\u003e tuple[dict[str, CallGraphFeedback], dict[str, CallGraphFeedback]]:\n    \"\"\"Generate feedback for both streams from comparison.\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 4. Update Stream Processing\n- Pass feedback to documenters in subsequent iterations\n- Log feedback application for debugging\n- Track feedback effectiveness over iterations\n\n### 5. Prompt Engineering for Feedback\nDesign prompts that effectively communicate discrepancies:\n```\nPrevious iteration found discrepancies in your call graph for {component_id}:\n\nStream B identified these calls that you missed:\n- {callee1} at line {line} (reason: {evidence})\n- {callee2} at line {line} (reason: {evidence})\n\nPlease verify and update your call graph. If you believe your original\nanalysis was correct, explain why.\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Documenters receive structured feedback about call graph discrepancies\n- [ ] Feedback includes evidence from the other stream\n- [ ] Documenters can accept or reject feedback with reasoning\n- [ ] Feedback loop tracks iterations and convergence progress\n- [ ] System handles conflicting feedback gracefully\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/models/` - Add feedback.py\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/agents/documenter.py` - Add feedback input\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/agents/stream.py` - Pass feedback to documenters\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/orchestrator/orchestrator.py` - Generate and distribute feedback\n\n## Dependencies\n- **Depends on:** twinscribe-3by (Remove static analysis as ground truth)\n\n## Complexity\n**Size:** L (Large)\n**Risk:** Medium - New feature, isolated from existing logic","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:40:46.833493-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi","updated_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.639657-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.639657-07:00","close_reason":"Implemented consensus-based resolution architecture","labels":["architecture","call-graph","consensus","feedback-loop"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"twinscribe-b6a","depends_on_id":"twinscribe-3by","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:40:46.834938-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi"},{"issue_id":"twinscribe-b6a","depends_on_id":"twinscribe-3by","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:42:28.323236-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi"}]}

{"id":"twinscribe-d62","title":"Implement checkpoint/resume for documentation processing","description":"## Overview\n\nImplement a robust checkpoint and resume system for documentation processing to handle long-running documentation jobs reliably.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **State Persistence**: Persist state after every small step during documentation processing\n2. **Resume Capability**: Enable the system to resume from where it left off after interruption\n3. **Fail-Fast on Error**: Quit immediately on any error (including validation errors)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] State is persisted after each component is documented\n- [ ] System can be restarted and resume from last checkpoint\n- [ ] Processing stops immediately on first error\n- [ ] Checkpoint state includes: processed components, current position, error state\n- [ ] Checkpoint files are atomic (no partial writes)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Plan (v1.0)\n\n### 1. Overview and Design Philosophy\n\nThe checkpoint/resume system follows these principles:\n- **Append-only JSONL**: Each checkpoint is a single line appended to a file (crash-safe)\n- **Component-level granularity**: Checkpoint after each component is fully processed\n- **Fail-fast semantics**: Any error immediately halts processing and saves failure state\n- **Idempotent resume**: Re-processing the same component produces identical results\n\n### 2. Checkpoint File Format\n\n**Location**: `.beads/checkpoints/` (alongside other beads data) or `output/checkpoints/`\n\n**File naming**: `checkpoint_{run_id}.jsonl`\n\n**JSONL Format** - One JSON object per line, append-only:\n\n```json\n{\"type\":\"run_start\",\"run_id\":\"run_20260107_143000\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:30:00Z\",\"config\":{\"codebase_path\":\"/path/to/code\",\"max_iterations\":5}}\n{\"type\":\"discovery_complete\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:30:05Z\",\"total_components\":150,\"processing_order\":[\"mod.A\",\"mod.B\",\"mod.C\"]}\n{\"type\":\"component_processed\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:30:10Z\",\"component_id\":\"mod.A\",\"stream\":\"A\",\"iteration\":1,\"status\":\"success\",\"doc_hash\":\"abc123\"}\n{\"type\":\"component_processed\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:30:15Z\",\"component_id\":\"mod.A\",\"stream\":\"B\",\"iteration\":1,\"status\":\"success\",\"doc_hash\":\"def456\"}\n{\"type\":\"component_validated\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:30:20Z\",\"component_id\":\"mod.A\",\"stream\":\"A\",\"iteration\":1,\"status\":\"pass\"}\n{\"type\":\"comparison_complete\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:31:00Z\",\"component_id\":\"mod.A\",\"iteration\":1,\"converged\":false,\"discrepancy_count\":1}\n{\"type\":\"iteration_complete\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:35:00Z\",\"iteration\":1,\"components_processed\":150,\"discrepancies\":12}\n{\"type\":\"error\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:35:05Z\",\"phase\":\"documenting\",\"component_id\":\"mod.B\",\"stream\":\"A\",\"error\":\"Rate limit exceeded\",\"traceback\":\"...\"}\n{\"type\":\"run_complete\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-07T14:40:00Z\",\"status\":\"completed\",\"total_components\":150,\"iterations\":3}\n```\n\n### 3. Checkpoint Event Types\n\n| Event Type | Saved When | Key Fields |\n|------------|------------|------------|\n| `run_start` | Pipeline begins | run_id, config, timestamp |\n| `discovery_complete` | Component discovery done | total_components, processing_order, source_code_hashes |\n| `component_documented` | After documenter+validator | component_id, stream, iteration, status, output_hash |\n| `component_compared` | After comparison | component_id, iteration, converged, discrepancy_ids |\n| `discrepancy_created` | New discrepancy found | discrepancy_id, component_id, type, requires_beads |\n| `beads_ticket_created` | Ticket created | ticket_key, discrepancy_id, component_id |\n| `beads_resolution_applied` | Resolution applied | ticket_key, resolution_action |\n| `iteration_complete` | End of iteration | iteration, metrics, convergence_status |\n| `error` | Any error | phase, component_id, stream, error_message, traceback |\n| `run_complete` | Pipeline ends | status, final_metrics |\n\n### 4. State to Persist\n\nAt each checkpoint, the following state must be reconstructible:\n\n**Core Processing State:**\n- `run_id`: Unique run identifier\n- `phase`: Current orchestrator phase (discovering, documenting, comparing, resolving, etc.)\n- `current_iteration`: Current iteration number (1-based)\n- `processing_order`: List of component_ids in topological order\n\n**Per-Component State:**\n- `processed_components`: Map of component_id -\u003e {stream_a_done, stream_b_done, validated, compared}\n- `pending_components`: List of component_ids not yet processed\n- `component_outputs`: Map of component_id -\u003e {stream, output_hash, output_file_path}\n\n**Comparison/Resolution State:**\n- `discrepancies`: Map of discrepancy_id -\u003e {component_id, type, status, resolution}\n- `beads_tickets`: Map of ticket_key -\u003e {status, component_id, discrepancy_id}\n\n**Error State:**\n- `last_error`: {phase, component_id, error_message, timestamp}\n- `failed`: Boolean indicating if run failed\n\n### 5. Output File Strategy\n\nDocumentation outputs should be persisted incrementally, not just at the end:\n\n```\noutput/\n  checkpoints/\n    checkpoint_{run_id}.jsonl       # Append-only checkpoint log\n  components/\n    {component_id_safe}.a.json      # Stream A output for component\n    {component_id_safe}.b.json      # Stream B output for component\n    {component_id_safe}.merged.json # Final merged output\n  comparisons/\n    comparison_iter_{n}.json        # Comparison results per iteration\n  metrics/\n    metrics_{run_id}.json           # Final run metrics\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Storing component outputs individually allows:\n1. Resume without re-calling LLMs for completed components\n2. Inspection of intermediate results\n3. Smaller atomic writes (no giant files)\n\n### 6.

Resume Detection Flow\n\n```\nCLI invoked with --resume flag\n    │\n    ▼\nCheckpointManager.find_resumable_runs(checkpoint_dir)\n    │\n    ├── No resumable runs found → Start fresh\n    │\n    └── Resumable run(s) found\n            │\n            ▼\n        Load checkpoint_state from JSONL\n            │\n            ▼\n        Validate state consistency\n        (check output files exist, hashes match)\n            │\n            ▼\n        Reconstruct OrchestratorState\n            │\n            ▼\n        Identify pending_components\n            │\n            ▼\n        Resume processing from next pending component\n```\n\n### 8. Fail-Fast Error Handling Integration\n\n```python\n# In DualStreamOrchestrator._run_iteration():\n\nasync def _process_component_with_checkpoint(\n    self,\n    component: Component,\n    stream: DocumentationStream,\n) -\u003e DocumentationOutput:\n    \"\"\"Process a single component with fail-fast and checkpointing.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        output = await stream.process_single(component)\n        \n        # Save output to file\n        output_path = self._save_component_output(component.component_id, stream.stream_id, output)\n        \n        # Record checkpoint\n        self._checkpoint_manager.record_component_documented(\n            component_id=component.component_id,\n            stream_id=stream.stream_id,\n            iteration=self._state.iteration,\n            output=output,\n            output_path=output_path,\n        )\n        \n        return output\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        # Record error and fail fast\n        self._checkpoint_manager.record_error(\n            phase=self._state.phase,\n            component_id=component.component_id,\n            stream_id=stream.stream_id,\n            error=e,\n        )\n        # Re-raise to halt processing\n        raise ProcessingError(f\"Failed processing {component.component_id}: {e}\") from e\n```\n\n### 9. Atomic Write Strategy\n\nTo ensure checkpoint integrity:\n\n1. **JSONL append**: Each event is a single line, appended with `\\n`. Partial writes result in incomplete lines that are ignored on read.\n\n2. **Output files**: Write to temp file, then atomic rename:\n   ```python\n   def _save_component_output(self, component_id: str, stream_id: StreamId, output: DocumentationOutput) -\u003e Path:\n       output_path = self._output_dir / f\"{self._safe_filename(component_id)}.{stream_id.value.lower()}.json\"\n       temp_path = output_path.with_suffix('.tmp')\n       \n       with open(temp_path, 'w') as f:\n           f.write(output.model_dump_json(indent=2))\n       \n       temp_path.rename(output_path)  # Atomic on POSIX\n       return output_path\n   ```\n\n3. **fsync for durability**: Call `os.fsync()` after critical writes\n\n### 10. CLI Integration\n\n```bash\n# Start fresh run\ntwinscribe document /path/to/codebase --output ./output\n\n# Resume from checkpoint\ntwinscribe document /path/to/codebase --output ./output --resume\n\n# Resume specific run\ntwinscribe document /path/to/codebase --output ./output --resume-run run_20260107_143000\n\n# Force fresh start (ignore existing checkpoint)\ntwinscribe document /path/to/codebase --output ./output --fresh\n```\n\n### 11. Implementation Tasks Breakdown\n\n**Task 1: Add state persistence after each component (twinscribe-fbm)**\n- Create `CheckpointManager` class in `orchestrator/checkpoint.py`\n- Implement `record_*` methods for all event types\n- Integrate into `ConcreteDocumentationStream.process()` loop\n- Add atomic file write utilities\n\n**Task 2: Add resume capability (twinscribe-d2i)**\n- Implement `load_checkpoint_state()` method\n- Add `CheckpointState` model for reconstructed state\n- Modify `DualStreamOrchestrator.run()` to accept checkpoint state\n- Implement `get_pending_components()` logic\n- Add CLI `--resume` flag handling\n\n**Task 3: Implement fail-fast error handling (twinscribe-6op)**\n- Add `record_error()` method\n- Remove `continue_on_error` behavior from stream processing\n- Ensure all exceptions propagate and halt processing\n- Add error state to checkpoint format\n\n### 12. Testing Strategy\n\n1. **Unit tests for CheckpointManager**:\n   - Test JSONL append/read\n   - Test state reconstruction from various checkpoint states\n   - Test handling of corrupted/incomplete checkpoints\n\n2. **Integration tests**:\n   - Simulate crash mid-processing, verify resume\n   - Test resume after rate limit errors\n   - Test fresh start vs resume behavior\n\n3. **End-to-end tests**:\n   - Process small codebase with injected failures\n   - Verify final output matches non-interrupted run\n\n### 13. Migration/Compatibility\n\n- Existing `CheckpointManager` in `orchestrator/state.py` uses different format (single JSON files)\n- New implementation will be parallel initially, then replace\n- No migration needed for existing runs (they don't use checkpoints effectively)\n\n---\n\n## Related Issues\n\nThis epic contains the following tasks:\n- twinscribe-fbm: Add state persistence after each component is processed\n- twinscribe-d2i: Add resume capability to continue from last checkpoint\n- twinscribe-6op: Implement fail-fast error handling - quit on first error\n\n## Priority\n\nP0 - Critical for production reliability","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-07T20:43:14.109576-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi","updated_at":"2026-01-07T21:02:13.097689-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T21:02:13.097689-07:00","close_reason":"All child tasks completed: state persistence, fail-fast error handling, and resume capability implemented"}

{"id":"twinscribe-d98","title":"[ARCH] Make static analysis optional (support non-Python languages)","description":"## Summary\nMake static analysis completely optional so twinscribe can document codebases in languages without static analyzers (COBOL, JCL, legacy code, proprietary languages). Static analysis becomes \"hints\" when available, not a requirement.\n\n## Background\nWith ground truth authority moved to consensus (twinscribe-3by), static analysis is no longer required for operation. This ticket ensures the system gracefully handles:\n- Languages with no static analyzer support\n- Environments where static analysis tools aren't installed\n- Mixed-language codebases\n\n## Implementation Design\n\n### 1. Update Oracle to be Optional\n```python\nclass DualStreamOrchestrator:\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        config: OrchestratorConfig,\n        static_oracle: Optional[\"StaticAnalysisOracle\"] = None,  # Now optional\n        stream_a: \"DocumentationStream\",\n        stream_b: \"DocumentationStream\",\n        comparator: \"ComparatorAgent\",\n        beads_manager: Optional[\"BeadsLifecycleManager\"] = None,\n    ) -\u003e None:\n```\n\n### 2. Add Graceful Degradation\n```python\nasync def _initialize(self) -\u003e None:\n    \"\"\"Initialize the pipeline.\"\"\"\n    # Try to initialize oracle if provided\n    if self._oracle is not None:\n        try:\n            if not self._oracle.is_initialized:\n                await self._oracle.initialize()\n            logger.info(\"Static analysis available - will use as hints\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.warning(f\"Static analysis unavailable: {e} - proceeding without\")\n            self._oracle = None\n    else:\n        logger.info(\"No static analyzer configured - using consensus-only mode\")\n```\n\n### 3. Update Agent Prompts for Hint Mode\nWhen static analysis is available but not authoritative:\n```\nYou have access to static analysis hints (may be incomplete or inaccurate):\n- Static analysis suggests callees: {hint_callees}\n- Static analysis suggests callers: {hint_callers}\n\nUse these as helpful context, but verify against the source code.\nYour analysis and the other stream's analysis are authoritative.\n```\n\n### 4. Configuration Updates\n```python\nclass OrchestratorConfig(BaseModel):\n    # ... existing fields ...\n    require_static_analysis: bool = Field(\n        default=False,  # Changed from True\n        description=\"Require static analysis to run (fail if unavailable)\"\n    )\n    static_analysis_weight: float = Field(\n        default=0.3, ge=0.0, le=1.0,\n        description=\"Weight given to static analysis hints (0 = ignore, 1 = strong hint)\"\n    )\n```\n\n### 5. Update Validation Flow\n- Validator should work without ground truth\n- Flag when static analysis disagrees with consensus\n- Include \"static analysis hint mismatch\" in validation output\n\n### 6. Update CLI\n```python\n@click.option(\n    '--no-static-analysis',\n    is_flag=True,\n    help='Run without static analysis (pure consensus mode)'\n)\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] System runs successfully without any static analyzer\n- [ ] CLI has option to explicitly skip static analysis\n- [ ] When oracle fails to initialize, system continues with warning\n- [ ] Static analysis is clearly labeled as \"hints\" in outputs\n- [ ] Documentation quality is maintained without static analysis\n- [ ] Multi-language codebases work (Python + COBOL in same project)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/orchestrator/orchestrator.py` - Make oracle optional\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/config/models.py` - Add config options\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/cli.py` - Add --no-static-analysis flag\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/agents/validator.py` - Handle missing ground truth\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/agents/comparator.py` - Handle missing ground truth\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/agents/documenter.py` - Use hints in prompts\n\n## Dependencies\n- **Depends on:** twinscribe-3by (Remove static analysis as ground truth)\n- **Independent of:** twinscribe-b6a, twinscribe-wdv, twinscribe-ngz (can be developed in parallel)\n\n## Complexity\n**Size:** M (Medium)\n**Risk:** Low - Making things optional is low risk","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:41:56.41795-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi","updated_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.703517-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.703517-07:00","close_reason":"Implemented consensus-based resolution architecture","labels":["architecture","multi-language","optional","static-analysis"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"twinscribe-d98","depends_on_id":"twinscribe-3by","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:41:56.419063-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi"},{"issue_id":"twinscribe-d98","depends_on_id":"twinscribe-3by","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:42:28.564769-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi"}]}

LLM is returning empty string for a callee reference\n2. Static analysis is returning empty callee IDs\n3. Normalization/parsing logic is creating empty IDs\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Run documentation on `connectchain.examples.lcel_multi_model` module\n2. Processing reaches `PrintLogger` component\n3. Validation error is raised\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- Either reject/skip callees with empty IDs at the source\n- Or handle empty IDs gracefully before validation\n\n### Proposed Fix\n\n1. **Validation Layer**: Add early validation in the documenter agent to filter out empty callee references before creating CalleeRef objects\n\n2. **LLM Prompt Enhancement**: Update prompts to explicitly instruct LLM not to return empty component IDs\n\n3. **Defensive Parsing**: Add filtering in the call graph normalization:\n   ```python\n   callees = [c for c in raw_callees if c.component_id.strip()]\n   ```\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Processing does not fail on empty component_id\n- [ ] Empty callee references are filtered out with warning\n- [ ] Root cause is identified and fixed\n- [ ] Similar edge cases are handled (whitespace-only IDs, etc.)\n\n### Priority\n\nP1 - High - This is blocking documentation processing\n\n### Labels\n\nbug, blocking, validation, callgraph","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-07T20:44:12.596737-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi","updated_at":"2026-01-07T20:46:16.628039-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T20:46:16.628039-07:00","close_reason":"Fixed by filtering empty component_id values in _parse_response before creating CalleeRef/CallerRef objects"}

{"id":"twinscribe-ngz","title":"[ARCH] Update orchestrator for iterative call graph refinement","description":"## Summary\nAdd an iteration loop in the orchestrator that continues until call graphs converge between streams or max iterations are reached. Pass discrepancies as corrections to documenter input.\n\n## Background\nWith feedback loop (twinscribe-b6a) and convergence criteria (twinscribe-wdv) in place, the orchestrator needs to be updated to drive the iterative refinement process.\n\n## Implementation Design\n\n### 1. Add Configuration Options\n```python\nclass OrchestratorConfig(BaseModel):\n    # ... existing fields ...\n    max_call_graph_iterations: int = Field(\n        default=5, ge=1, le=10,\n        description=\"Max iterations for call graph convergence\"\n    )\n    call_graph_convergence_threshold: float = Field(\n        default=0.95, ge=0.5, le=1.0,\n        description=\"Required agreement rate for convergence\"\n    )\n    iterative_refinement_enabled: bool = Field(\n        default=True,\n        description=\"Enable iterative refinement via feedback loop\"\n    )\n```\n\n### 2. Update Iteration Loop\n```python\nasync def _run_iteration_loop(self) -\u003e bool:\n    \"\"\"Run the main iteration loop with call graph refinement.\"\"\"\n    call_graph_converged = False\n    call_graph_iteration = 0\n    \n    while not call_graph_converged and call_graph_iteration \u003c self._config.max_call_graph_iterations:\n        call_graph_iteration += 1\n        \n        # Generate feedback from previous comparison\n        if call_graph_iteration \u003e 1:\n            feedback_a, feedback_b = self._generate_call_graph_feedback(comparison)\n            self._stream_a.set_call_graph_feedback(feedback_a)\n            self._stream_b.set_call_graph_feedback(feedback_b)\n        \n        # Run documentation\n        result = await self._run_iteration()\n        \n        # Check call graph convergence\n        convergence_check = self._check_call_graph_convergence(result)\n        call_graph_converged = convergence_check.converged\n        \n        # Log progress\n        logger.info(\n            f\"Call graph iteration {call_graph_iteration}: \"\n            f\"{convergence_check.agreement_rate:.1%} agreement\"\n        )\n    \n    return call_graph_converged\n```\n\n### 3.

{"id":"twinscribe-wdv","title":"[ARCH] Implement convergence-based resolution for call graphs","description":"## Summary\nDefine and implement convergence criteria for dual-stream call graph consensus. When streams agree, accept as truth. When streams disagree after N iterations, create a Beads ticket for human review.\n\n## Background\nAfter implementing the feedback loop (twinscribe-b6a), we need clear criteria for when convergence is achieved and how to handle persistent disagreements.\n\n## Implementation Design\n\n### 1. Define Convergence Criteria\n```python\n# Extend models/convergence.py\nclass CallGraphConvergenceCriteria(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Criteria for call graph convergence between streams.\"\"\"\n    agreement_threshold: float = 0.95  # 95% of edges must match\n    max_iterations: int = 5            # Max attempts before escalation\n    min_confidence_for_accept: float = 0.8  # Confidence to auto-accept\n    require_bidirectional: bool = True # Both streams must agree\n```\n\n### 2. Implement Convergence Checker\n```python\nclass CallGraphConvergenceChecker:\n    \"\"\"Checks if call graphs have converged between streams.\"\"\"\n    \n    def check_convergence(\n        self,\n        stream_a_graph: CallGraph,\n        stream_b_graph: CallGraph,\n        iteration: int,\n    ) -\u003e ConvergenceResult:\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns:\n            ConvergenceResult with:\n            - converged: bool\n            - agreement_rate: float\n            - disagreeing_edges: list[CallEdge]\n            - recommendation: 'accept' | 'iterate' | 'escalate'\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\n### 3. Resolution Actions\n- **Converged (\u003e= 95% agreement):** Accept consensus as truth\n- **Partially converged (80-95%):** Continue iteration with targeted feedback\n- **Stalled (\u003c 80% after N iterations):** Create Beads ticket for human review\n- **Confident disagreement:** If one stream has high confidence, weight toward it\n\n### 4. Beads Ticket Creation for Non-Convergence\n```python\nasync def create_convergence_failure_ticket(\n    self,\n    component_id: str,\n    stream_a_graph: CallGraph,\n    stream_b_graph: CallGraph,\n    disagreeing_edges: list[CallEdge],\n    iteration_history: list[ConvergenceHistoryEntry],\n) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Create Beads ticket for human review of non-converging call graph.\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 5. Update Orchestrator Integration\n- Add convergence checking to `_run_iteration()`\n- Track convergence progress per component\n- Generate convergence report for final output\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Convergence criteria are configurable\n- [ ] System correctly identifies when streams have converged\n- [ ] Partial convergence triggers additional iterations with feedback\n- [ ] Non-convergence after max iterations creates Beads ticket\n- [ ] Beads ticket includes both perspectives and iteration history\n- [ ] Convergence metrics included in final documentation package\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/orchestrator/convergence.py` - Add call graph specific logic\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/models/convergence.py` - Add CallGraphConvergenceCriteria\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/orchestrator/orchestrator.py` - Integrate convergence checking\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/beads/templates.py` - Add convergence failure template\n- `/Users/andraslferenczi/twinscribe/src/twinscribe/beads/manager.py` - Add convergence ticket creation\n\n## Dependencies\n- **Depends on:** twinscribe-b6a (Implement call graph feedback loop)\n\n## Complexity\n**Size:** M (Medium)\n**Risk:** Low - Extends existing convergence framework","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:41:06.427488-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi","updated_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.661472-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T13:23:01.661472-07:00","close_reason":"Implemented consensus-based resolution architecture","labels":["architecture","beads","call-graph","consensus","convergence"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"twinscribe-wdv","depends_on_id":"twinscribe-b6a","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:41:06.428643-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi"},{"issue_id":"twinscribe-wdv","depends_on_id":"twinscribe-b6a","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:42:28.402613-07:00","created_by":"andraslferenczi"}]}
